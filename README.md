# ReversePolishNotationCalcStacks
A Reverse Polish Notation Calculator that uses stacks.

The Stack.py file has a class which lets us simulate a stack using a list. It has 5 different functions. A "__init__" function which initialises out 'stack'. There is also a "push" function which pushes and item to the stack. A "pop" function which removes the item at the top of the stack. An "isEmpty" function which verifies whether the stack is empty. There is also a "top" function which returns the item at the top of the stack.

The RPNCalc.py file runs the calculator. It allows the user to enter numbers and opperands.
